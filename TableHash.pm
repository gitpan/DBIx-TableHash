    my $DBHash = DBIx::TableHash->create_or_die
    (my $Params =
     {
         DBIDriver      => 'mysql', 
         Database       => 'mydatabase',
         HostName       => 'localhost',

    my %DBHash; tie(%DBHash, 'DBIx::TableHash', $Params);

    my $DBHash = DBIx::TableHash->create($Params) or die "Help!";
    my $DBHash = DBIx::TableHash->create_or_die($Params);

    my $DBHash = DBIx::TableHash->create_copy_or_die($Params);

=head1 OVERVIEW

All parameters are passed via a single anonymous hash.

All parameters are optional, but you'll almost always need to specify
Database, TableName, and KeyField.

Omitting ValueField puts the hash in "multi-value" mode, where you
store/retrieve a hash of fields/values instead of a single value.  In
"multi-value" mode all fields in each record are retrieved on every
fetch; RetrieveFields limits fields retrieved to a specified list.

Specifying FixedKeys puts the hash in "multi-key" mode, in which only
a subset of the database table, corresopnding to records that match
the spec in FixedKeys, is operated on.

Cache modes reduce querying, but lose synchronization and hog memory.

The object is designed to be easy subclass.  Try making a subclass
that sets defaults for all or most of the parameters, so the caller
doesn't have to supply any at instantiation time.

"create_copy" methods efficiently create and return potentially huge
untied hash "snapshot" of the same data that would have been retrieved
by the corresponding tied hash.


=head1 DETAILS

The DBHash object is designed to tie a hash to a table or a subset of
records in a table in a DBI database (only tested with mysql in the
current version, but expected to work with any vendor).

If the table only has a single KeyField, which this modules assumes to
be a unique key field in the table, then the hash keys are stored and
retrieved in that field, and the values are saved in and returned from
the ValueField.  Records are automatically created and deleted as the
hash is used like any other hash.  (If the table is read-only, be sure
not to try to store into the tied hash!)

To access only a subset of the records in a table, you may specify
hash of "FixedKeys", which is a hash mapping OTHER field names to
fixed values that those fields must have for all lookups, updates, and
inserts done via the hash interface.  This sets up a virtual hash
corresponding to a subset of the table where N key fields are fixed at
given values and a different key field may vary.

There are several ways to use this module.

Quick and dirty mode (single-key, single-value) using tie:

    use DBIx::TableHash;
    my %PhoneNumbers;
    tie (%PhoneNumbers, 'DBIx::TableHash', 
         {Database      => 'mydatabase', 
          TableName     => 'SalesPeople',
          KeyField      => 'FullName',
          ValueField    => 'PhoneNumber'})
        or die "Failed to connect to database";

Then you can use %PhoneNumbers like any hash mapping FullName to
PhoneNumber.  Any retrieval of data results in corresponding SQL
queries being made to the database.  Modifying the hash modifies the
database.


Even quicker mode using create():

For convenience, you can use the create() class method to do the tying
for you.  It creates an anonymous hash, ties it and, returns it.  It
takes the same parameters as new() and tie().

    use DBIx::TableHash;
    my $PhoneNumbers = DBIx::TableHash->create(......)
        or die "Failed to connect to database";

Quicker still using create_or_die():

    use DBIx::TableHash;
    my $PhoneNumbers = DBIx::TableHash->create_or_die(......);

create() carps and returns undef if it can't connect to the database.

create_or_die() croaks (dies) your program, with the same error
message as create() would have given.

Normally, create() will carp() (warn) you with an error message upon
failure, and return undef.

If you would have handled your error by saying "or die", and ar
comfortable with create's error message rather than your own, then
create_or_die() is for you.

Using one of the create() methods instead of new() and tie() works
with all of the different modes discussed below, and all parameters
are the same either way.


Cooler subclassing mode:

You can create a simple subclass that provides default parmas in an
initialize method so they don't have to be provided by the caller ...

    ### MyCompany/SalesPhoneHash.pm:

    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use strict;

    package   MyCompany::SalesPhoneHash;
    use       vars qw(@ISA);
    use       DBIx::TableHash;
    @ISA = qw(DBIx::TableHash);

    sub initialize
    {
        my $this = shift;

        $this->{Database}   ||= 'mydatabase';   ## Name of database to connect to.
        $this->{TableName}  ||= 'SalesPeople';  ## Table in which to store the data
        $this->{KeyField}   ||= 'FullName';     ## Name of the key field
        $this->{ValueField} ||= 'PhoneNumber';  ## Name of the value field.

      done:
        return($this->SUPER::initialize());
    }
    1;

Then to use the object, your script merely does:

    use MyCompany::SalesPhoneHash;
    my %PhoneNumbers = MyCompany::SalesPhoneHash->create_or_die();

Of course, when instantiating a subclass, if you wish you can still
override any parameters you wish, as long as the initialize() method
in the subclass uses ||= rather than = to set defaults for any
unspecified parameters.


Multi-key mode: 

You may also use the "FixedKeys" parameter to specify a hash of some
additional key fields and their fixed values that must match exactly
for any records that are retrieved, deleted, or created by the tied
object, effectively allowing the hash to operate on only a subset of
the data in the database.  This is typically helpful in a multi-keyed
table where, for the purposes of your script, all key values should be
fixed except one (and that one is the hash key).

    use DBIx::TableHash;
    my $PhoneNumbers = 
        DBIx::TableHash->
            create_or_die(
                          {Database     => 'mydatabase', 
                           TableName    => 'SalesPeople',
                           KeyField     => 'FullName',
                           ValueField   => 'PhoneNumbers',
                           FixedKeys        =>
                           {AreaCode        => 415,
                            StatusCode      => 'Active',
                            RecordType      => 'Primary'}});


Multi-value mode:

If instead of getting and setting a single value, you'd like to get or
set a hash of all fields in the record, simply don't specify
ValueField, and the object will use "multi-value" mode, where an
entire record, as a hash, is gotten or set on each fetch or store.
Feel free to combine this mode with multi-key mode.

When storing a record in multi-value mode, if the record already
exists, only the specified fields are overwritten.  If it did not
already exist, then only the specified fields will be written and the
others will be NULL or defaulted according to the table schema.

When storing a record in multi-value mode, you can't change the values
of the primary key field or any other key field specified in FixedKeys
(if any), since that would mess up the whole point of this module
which is to leave the main key and fixed keys fixed while mucking with
the other values in the record.  Any changed values in key fields are
simply ignored.

    use DBIx::TableHash;
    my $SalesPeopleTable = 
        DBIx::TableHash->
            create_or_die(
                          {Database     => 'mydatabase', 
                           TableName    => 'SalesPeople',
                           KeyField     => 'FullName'});

    my $SalesPersonFullName = "Joe Jones";
    my $EntireRecord = $SalesPeopleTable->{$SalesPersonFullName};

When fetching records in multi-value mode, you can limit the list of
returned fields to a subset of all available fields in case there
might be some very big ones that you don't want to waste bandwidth
getting.  Just set the RetrieveFields parameter to an anonymous list
of the fields you care to retrieve.  (This setting does not limit
the fields you can SET, just the ones that get retrieved.)

    use DBIx::TableHash;
    my $SalesPeopleTable = 
        DBIx::TableHash->
            create_or_die(
                          {Database     => 'mydatabase', 
                           TableName    => 'SalesPeople',
                           KeyField     => 'FullName',
                           RetrieveFields=> [qw(Territory Quota)]});

Warning: 

In multi-value mode, you might expect that this:

    $Hash->{$MyKey}->{FieldX} = 'foo';

would set the value of the FieldX field in the appropriate record in
the database.  IT DOES NOT.

This is because the anonymous hash returned by $Hash->{$MyKey} is not
in any way tied back to the database.  You'd have to retrieve the
record hash, change any value in it, and then set $Hash->{$MyKey} back
to it.  

Making the above syntax work with a multi-valued tied hash to set a
value in the database is a possible future enhancement under
consideration by the author.  Let me know if you would like to have
that work.  

In the meanwhile, here's how you do could do it:


    (my $Record = $Hash->{$MyKey})->{FieldX} = 'foo';
    $Hash->{$MyKey}->{FieldX} = $Record;

WARNING: If you use the above approach to update a record in
multi-value mode, beware that there's potentially a race condition in
the above code if someone else updates the same record after you've
copied it but before you've modified and set it.  So use this
technique with caution and understanding.  If in doubt, don't use this
module and instead use an SQL query to update the record in a single
transaction.  Only you know the usage patterns of your database, the
concurrency issues, and the criticality of errors.


Caching modes:

The object has several ways it can cache data to help minimize the
number of SQL queries to the database, at the expense of potentially
dramatically increased memory usage.  The following cache parameters
can be specified to enable caching:

    CacheMode => 'CacheBeforeIterate'

    CacheMode => 'CacheOneTime'

Normally, every time you fetch a value from the hash, it makes an SQL
query to the database.  This, of course, is the intended and normal
mode of operation.  

Unfortunately, in Perl, just calling values(%Hash) or each(%Hash) or
even copying the hash with {%Hash} results in a separate FETCH, and
consequently, a separate SQL query made by this module, for each item.
This could result in thousands of queries just to fetch all the values
from a thousand-item table in the database.

However, often you want to iterate over all the elements of a hash
without it having to go back to the database and issue another query
for each item that you retrieve.

Using the 'CacheBeforeIterate' mode, all keys and values are cached
upon each call to FIRSTKEYS (i.e. at the start of any iteration or
enumeration).  Then, any subsequent calls to FETCH data from the hash
retrieve it from the cache instead of doing an SQL query.  STORING or
DELETING any items from the hash results in them being stored and
deleted from both the database and the cache.

Using the CacheOneTime mode, the full cache is built at object
instantiation and time never fully rebuilt.  In fact, its contents
never change unless you make alterations by using it to store into
and/or delete from the database.

CACHE WARNING: With both caching modes, of course, you must be
comfortable with the fact that the data being retrieved is a
"snapshot" of the database and consequently will not reflect updates
done by other parties during the lifetime of the object; it will only
reflect updates that you make by storing or deleting values from it.
If other people are using the database simultaneously, your cache and
the actual data could "drift" out of agreement.  This is mainly
dangerous to you, not others, unless you then go make updates to the
data based on potentially outdated values.


All modes may be combined...

All modes and parameters are orthogonal, so any combination of
parameters may be specified, with the exception that the
RetrieveFields parameter is only meaningful when ValueField is not
unspecified.

With subclassing, you may create objects that pre-specify any
parameters, even those that affect the major modes of operation.  For
example, you may combine the subclassing technique and the multi-key
mode to make an object that accesses only the appropriate subset of a
multi-keyed table without requiring any parameters to be supplied by
the caller.


Getting a COPY of the data instead of a tied hash:

What if you just want a big copy -- a snapshot -- of the data in the
table, in a regular old hash that's no longer tied to the database at
all?  (Memory constraints be damned!)

Just use the create_copy() or create_copy_or_die() methods.  They work
just like create() and create_or_die(), but instead of returning a
tied object, they just return a potentially huge hash containing a
copy of all the data.

In other words:

   create_copy()        is equivalent to: {%{create() || {} }}
   create_copy_or_die() is equivalent to: {%{create_or_die()}}

... but the _copy methods are more efficient because internally, a
caching mode is used to minimize the queries to the database and
generate the hash as efficiently as possible.

In all other respects, create_copy() and create_copy_or_die() perform
exactly like their non-copying namesakes, taking all the same
parameters, except CacheMode which is not relevant when making a
static copy.

Please remember that the object returned by the _copy methods is no
longer tied to the database.

                                    mysql has currently been tested by the
                                    author).

    HostName    'localhost'     Host name containing the database and table;

    Port        undef           Port number if different from the standard.
    
    Login       ''              Login to use when connecting, if any.

    Password       ''               Password to use when connecting, if any.

SQL Parameters

    Param       Default         Description
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Database    ''              Name of database to connect to.

    TableName   ''              Table to connect to.

    KeyField    ''              Name of field in which lookup key is found.

    ValueField  ''              Name of field to pull value from.
                                If empty or undef, then a
                                multi-value hash is used both for
                                saving and retrieving.  This is
                                called "multi-value mode".

Module Parameters

    Param       Default         Description
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    FixedKeys   {}              If supplied, gives names and
                                fixed, hardcoded values that other
                                keys in the table must have; this
                                effectively limits the scope of
                                the tied hash from operating over
                                the entire table to operating over
                                just the subset of records that
                                match the values in FixedKeys.
                                This is called "multi-key mode".

    RetrieveFields  []          In multi-value mode, limits the
                                fields that are retrieved; default
                                is all fields in the record.

=head1 SUPPORT

I am unable to provide any technical support for this module.  The
whole reason I had to make it was that I was way too busy (lazy?) to
write all that SQL code...

But you are encouraged to send patches, bug warnings, updates, thanks,
or suggestions for improvements to the author as listed below.

Just be aware that I may not have time to respond.  Please be sure to
put the name of this module somewhere in the Subject line.

The code is a pretty simple tied hash implementation, so you're on
your own to debug it.  If you're having trouble debugging via the
"tie" interface, try instantiating an object directly (or retrieving
it when you tie (see perltie)) and calling its methods individually.
Use the debugger or Data::Dumper to dump intermediate values at key
points, or whatever it takes.  Use your database server logs if you
want to see what SQL code is getting generated.  Or contribute a
debugging mode to this module which prints out or logs the SQL
statements before executing them.

=head1 BUGS/GOTCHAS

Problem: If you iterate or enumerate the hash, all keys get pulled in
from the database and stay stored in memory for the lifetime of the
object.  FIRSTKEY, which is called every time you do a keys(), each()
or any full iteration or enumeration over the tied hash (such as
copying it) retrieves and hangs on to a full list of all keys in
KeyField.  If the keys are long or there are lots of them, this could
be a memory problem.  (Don't confuse this with CacheMode in which BOTH
keys AND values are stored in memory.)

Solutions:  

    1) Don't iterate or enumerate.  Just fetch and store.
    2) Only iterate or enumerate on short tables. 
    3) LValue or RValue hash slices should be safe to do.

### encoded or otherwise manipulated before storage (e.g. serialized,
### encrypted, etc), in which case FixUpRetrieval should also be
### subclassed.

	## fields for safety before trying to store.

### This is called after values have been retrieved from the database
### but before they are returned to the user.

### Here's where a subclassed method could decrypt, decode,
